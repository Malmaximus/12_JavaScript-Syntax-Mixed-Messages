# Random Fortune Message Generator
==================================== 

## Description:
  For this project, I have build a message generator program. Every time a user runs this program, they should get a new, randomized output.

### Features:
  For now, it's just a function that pulls a silly quote from an array.

### How to use:
  Just run the function.

### Technologies:
  - Javascript
  - Git and GitHub
  - VSCode
  - Command Line 
  - Google, Internet, My computer... 

### Collaborators:
  Just me, myself and I this time sadly.
